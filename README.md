# Uno!

This game was created as part of a group project in Fall 2019. This version
of the game is single-player, but the original version used a game server to
allow multiple players to connect and play together.

To start the game, clone the repo and install the python dependencies located in `requirements.txt`. Then run `python main.py`.
