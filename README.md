# Uno!

This game was created as part of a group project in Fall 2019. This version
of the game is single-player, but the original version used a game server to
allow multiple players to connect and play together.

My responsibility on this project was creating the user interface. All of the animations in the game were created from scratch. With every frame, all of the assets on screen must report their position and their surface, which is then blitted onto the screen. I used an object oriented approach for the animation framework to maximize reusability. I provided my teammates with a clear and simple interface for adding objects to the screen and moving them around.

To start the game, clone the repo and install the python dependencies located in `requirements.txt`. Then run `python main.py`.
